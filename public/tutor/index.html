      <h3>What is peer tutoring?</h3>
      <p>Handsworth’s Peer Tutoring Program is a volunteer program that allows students to help their peers and give back to the school community. Peer tutors are matched up one-on-one or sometimes in small groups in the subject(s) they have volunteered
        to tutor. Any student, no matter what grade level, can sign up to peer tutor if they feel they are strong enough in a subject to assist others that may be struggling. If you are interested in becoming a peer tutor and giving back to the Handsworth
        community, please see Ms. McHugh in the Library Learning Commons for more information or drop off the signup sheet to her.</p>
      <h3>Why should I become one?</h3>
      <p>If you volunteer to become a peer tutor you will likely be making a huge impact on a student’s learning and giving them a better chance for success in school! Additionally, post-secondary institutions are always interested in seeing how their applicants
        have given back to their school communities and volunteer tutoring is a fabulous way to show this. Peer tutoring fosters a sense of school community and our abundance of student role models at this school is a large part of the reason Handsworth
        students continue to have some of the highest academic achievement levels in the province. In the words of Roman philosopher Seneca, “while we teach, we learn” and tutoring others is also a fantastic way to reinforce your own understanding and
        knowledge of a subject! We hope you will consider enrolling and making a huge difference for one of your peers!</p>
      <h3>Once I apply, how long does it take to get matched up with a student who needs tutoring?</h3>
      <p>We try and match up students as quickly as possible over email. How long it will take to receive a match will depend on the demand and the subject(s)/grade level(s) you have offered tutor, as well as how many students are in front of you on the
        sign-up list. You may receive an email the day you enroll or it may take up to 3-4 weeks. Check your email inbox frequently for an email from Ms. McHugh with your student tutoring match. Once signed up you may also check with Ms. McHugh at any
        time to see where you are on the list. If at any time while on the wait list you no longer wish to be a peer tutor please let Ms. McHugh know as soon as possible so she can remove you. If you are interested we suggest applying as soon as you can
        at the start of school year – but we do accept enrolments anytime throughout the year!</p>
      <h3>Who will I be matched with?</h3>
      <p>You will be matched with a student who needs help in only the subject area(s) and grade level(s) you have volunteered to peer tutor. You will only be matched with one student unless otherwise discussed. If you are a Grade 8 who has volunteered to
        tutor, you may be matched with a fellow Grade 8 who is in need of help, or an elementary student from one of our Handsworth family of schools. Any Grade 8’s applying please note the expected wait time for a match is typically one month.</p>
      <h3>If I sign up, how often do I need to peer tutor?</h3>
      <p>Once matched with the student you are peer tutoring it is up to the two of you to determine when and how often you meet based on your schedules. Since you are volunteering your time, I generally suggest the tutor indicate the times he/she is available.
        I would suggest meeting with your tutor match once a week and taking it from there. If you are both able to, you certainly can meet more frequently. A minimum of three times a month is the general expectation – please indicate when you enroll
        if your schedule is extremely limited.</p>
      <h3>Is it possible to only sign up as a peer tutor for a set amount of time?</h3>
      <p>We understand throughout the year you may become busy for a number of reasons (extracurricular activities such as sports, commitment to a job, higher work load, etc.). If you can only commit to a set amount of time to peer tutor, please indicate
        this clearly on your application form. For example; “I can commit to peer tutoring only until winter break.” This way we can work to find the student another peer tutor to take over for you when you stop the program.</p>
      <h3>Where is the best place to meet my partner? When does peer tutoring take place?</h3>
      <p>The Library Learning Commons, main hall, the café, open classrooms, or anywhere on school grounds are the best places to meet your peer tutoring partner. There is no specific or organized time peer tutoring takes place - it is based on you and your
        partner’s schedule. Suggested times to meet are during Wednesday’s Royal Flex Time, after school, during a spare if you are fortunate enough to have the same one as your partner, or during lunch. Please do not meet for peer tutoring off of school
        grounds or in unsupervised areas.</p>
