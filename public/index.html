        <h3>Kitchen Princess <span class="bookAuthor">by Natsumi Ando and Miyuki Kobayashi</span></h3>
        <p class="quote">I love the storyline of this manga, it's a mix of drama, romance, and a tiny bit of action. My favorite character in the series is Daichi Kitazawa because he is so funny, and gets really jealous, almost like a child. I hope other people read this
          manga because it is really interesting. I could stay up all night reading Kitchen Princess. The art is amazing, and I hope one day I will be able to draw characters as pretty as Natsumi Ando! I hope other people enjoy this manga just like I
          do!

        <h3>Anything Could Happen <span class="bookAuthor">by Will Walton</span></h3>
        <p class="quote">I first saw this book by Will Walton in a recommended feed. Ms. McHugh ordered it for Library and when it came in I got straight to reading! Anything Could Happen is a universal love story that will surprize you. It is enthralling and well worth
          the read. It is a wholesome LGBTQ story that will make you happy you picked it up!</p>

        <p class="quote">I recently borrowed The Woman In Cabin 10 and was not disappointed. The writer Ruth Ware's style was really visual and interesting. The plot of this book kept me intrigued the whole time and I would definitely recommend it to most readers!</p>

        <h3>Throne of Glass <span class="bookAuthor">by Sarah J. Maas</span></h3>
        <p class="quote">Throne of Glass is an excellent fantasy story, with romance, mystery, and it is a wonderful start to a series. The main protagonist, Celaena, is an amazing well developed character.</p>

        <h3>The Night Circus <span class="bookAuthor">by Erin Morgenstern</span></h3>
        <p class="quote">The Night Circus was one of my favourite reads. It has the perfect blend of suspense, emotion, and magical allure. The story really transports you to a fantasy world where it seems like anything is possible. I would recommend borrowing this book
          to anyone who likes fantasy and thrillers!</p>

        <h3>Scorched Earth <span class="bookAuthor">by Robert Munchamore</span></h3>
        <p class="quote">I recently finished reading Robert Muchamore's Henderson's Boys Series. I really enjoy his books - Scorched Earth was probably one of my favourites. I liked the depth he went into with each of his characters and even a summary the end to explain
          what happened to each of them.</p>

        <h3>The Hate You Give <span class="bookAuthor">by Angie Thomas</span></h3>
        <p class="quote">The Hate You Give is an excellent and insightful story, I am so glad I took it out of the Library. The book follows a youth navigating two different types of worlds. The plot includes romance, but is mainly about activism, which is why I liked
          it. The book is so well written it was like watching a movie, except I was reading it..</p>

        <h3>The Tattooist of Auschwitz <span class="bookAuthor">by Heather Morris</span></h3>
        <p class="quote">This novel teaches an invaluable life lesson. Love wins. Even in the midst of pure evil and hate, love can still win. This novel is based on the real experiences of Holocaust victims, and proves that love and friendship were still able to blossom
          in Auschwitz - one of the most voltatile Nazi death/labour camps during the Holocaust.</p>

        <p>We recognize the value of ensuring students have access to healthy food. The Food Access Program allows access to nutritional food all day for every student that does not have access to food on a regular basis. Food access is not just driven by socio economic factors. Knowing that there are students throughout our entire North Vancouver School District who do not have access to regular nutritious food, the program ensure there are available nutritious snack for students available in the Learning Commons, Choices, Main Office, Counselling office, as well as other points throughout the school!</p>
