        <p class="quote">This year I have been tutoring a Grade 10 student Marcos on Mondays and Wednesdays during lunch time and after school. I really enjoy helping Marcos improve his math! We have been working mostly on trigonometry and algebra. I'm glad to see he has been improving and I'm happy to be helping other students out at Handsworth.</p>

        <p class="quote">My Handsworth French Immersion teachers Mme. Poole, Mme. Yaraghi, and others have taught me so much over the years and helped in my success. I feel it's a responsibility of mine to give back to the school and help my peers in the way they have helped me.</p>

        <p class="quote">I appreciate the opportunity the school has given me to give back to my peers. I also would really recommend applying if you are a senior planning to improve your University application. Tutoring Ege has also helped me strengthen my own skills
          and kept me sharp in mathematics.</p>
