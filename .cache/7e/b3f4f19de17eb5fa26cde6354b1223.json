and Miyuki Kobayashi</span></h3> <p class=\"quote\">I love the storyline of this manga, it's a mix of drama, romance, and a tiny bit of action. My favorite character in the series is Daichi Kitazawa because he is so funny, and gets really jealous, almost like a child. I hope other people read this manga because it is really interesting. I could stay up all night reading Kitchen Princess. The art is amazing, and I hope one day I will be able to draw characters as pretty as Natsumi Ando! I hope other people enjoy this manga just like I do!</p> <p class=\"quoteAuthor\">Abigail Hathway<br>Handsworth Student, Grade 8</p> </div> <div class=\"newBook moreB book2\"> <img src=\"/7e468d13bccaf85bc55ba45024c88721.jpg\" alt=\"Cover of Anything Could Happen\"> <h3>Anything Could Happen <span class=\"bookAuthor\">by Will Walton</span></h3> <p class=\"quote\">I first saw this book by Will Walton in a recommended feed. Ms. McHugh ordered it for Library and when it came in I got straight to reading! Anything Could Happen is a universal love story that will surprize you. It is enthralling and well worth the read. It is a wholesome LGBTQ story that will make you happy you picked it up!</p> <p class=\"quoteAuthor\">Aakib Janmohamed<br>Handsworth Student, Grade 9</p> </div> <div class=\"newBook moreB book3\"> <img src=\"/83f73196eb58bf21d67655c0fc28d9f3.jpg\" alt=\"Cover of The Woman in Cabin 10\"> <h3>The Woman in Cabin 10 <span class=\"bookAuthor\">by Ruth Ware</span></h3> <p class=\"quote\">I recently borrowed The Woman In Cabin 10 and was not disappointed. The writer Ruth Ware's style was really visual and interesting. The plot of this book kept me intrigued the whole time and I would definitely recommend it to most readers!</p> <p class=\"quoteAuthor\">Maddy Lim<br>Handsworth Student, Grade 11</p> </div> <div class=\"newBook moreB book4\"> <img src=\"/578afff2e76eb58a443d3803c61089b3.jpg\" alt=\"Cover of Throne of Glass\"> <h3>Throne of Glass <span class=\"bookAuthor\">by Sarah J. Maas</span></h3> <p class=\"quote\">Throne of Glass is an excellent fantasy story, with romance, mystery, and it is a wonderful start to a series. The main protagonist, Celaena, is an amazing well developed character.</p> <p class=\"quoteAuthor\">Fiona Whyte<br>Handsworth Student, Grade 12</p> </div> <div class=\"newBook moreB book5\"> <img src=\"/a5c5d4ce3bdb1b2ce6f21d7627667275.jpg\" alt=\"Cover of The Night Circus\"> <h3>The Night Circus <span class=\"bookAuthor\">by Erin Morgenstern</span></h3> <p class=\"quote\">The Night Circus was one of my favourite reads. It has the perfect blend of suspense, emotion, and magical allure. The story really transports you to a fantasy world where it seems like anything is possible. I would recommend borrowing this book to anyone who likes fantasy and thrillers!</p> <p class=\"quoteAuthor\">Anova Hou<br>Handsworth Student, Grade 11</p> </div> <div class=\"newBook moreB book6\"> <img src=\"/da8bde5707f895b17933b07cc1a4b33a.jpg\" alt=\"Cover of Scorched Earth\"> <h3>Scorched Earth <span class=\"bookAuthor\">by Robert Munchamore</span></h3> <p class=\"quote\">I recently finished reading Robert Muchamore's Henderson's Boys Series. I really enjoy his books - Scorched Earth was probably one of my favourites. I liked the depth he went into with each of his characters and even a summary the end to explain what happened to each of them.</p> <p class=\"quoteAuthor\">Lachlan Parr<br>Handsworth Student, Grade 10</p> </div> <div class=\"newBook moreB book7\"> <img src=\"/1d651f0b11fe0f985990632660657b59.jpg\" alt=\"Cover of The Hate You Give\"> <h3>The Hate You Give <span class=\"bookAuthor\">by Angie Thomas</span></h3> <p class=\"quote\">The Hate You Give is an excellent and insightful story, I am so glad I took it out of the Library. The book follows a youth navigating two different types of worlds. The plot includes romance, but is mainly about activism, which is why I liked it. The book is so well written it was like watching a movie, except I was reading it..</p> <p class=\"quoteAuthor\">Lilie Kemp<br>Handsworth Student, Grade 10</p> </div> <div class=\"newBook moreB book8\"> <img src=\"/6835a936cda3d94bbc86356a46c6530e.jpg\" alt=\"Cover of The Tattooist of Auschwitz\"> <h3>The Tattooist of Auschwitz <span class=\"bookAuthor\">by Heather Morris</span></h3> <p class=\"quote\">This novel teaches an invaluable life lesson. Love wins. Even in the midst of pure evil and hate, love can still win. This novel is based on the real experiences of Holocaust victims, and proves that love and friendship were still able to blossom in Auschwitz - one of the most voltatile Nazi death/labour camps during the Holocaust.</p> <p class=\"quoteAuthor\">Ms. Carlson<br>Handsworth Teacher</p> </div> <div class=\"newBook moreB book9\"> <img src=\"/b95cee5dac9b88df36f4d7161183be8a.jpg\" alt=\"Cover of Blood of Olympus\"> <h3>Blood of Olympus <span class=\"bookAuthor\">by Rick Riordan</span></h3> <p class=\"quote\">I loved Blood of Olympus! This book is a real page turner; I wished it would have never ended.. you feel as if you are accompanying the heroes on their quest!</p> <p class=\"quoteAuthor\">Charlotte Pollock<br>Handsworth Student, Grade 8</p> </div> <div class=\"newBook moreB book10\"> <img src=\"/49b326582b55a823351630c419a4378b.jpg\" alt=\"Cover of The Gangster\"> <h3>The Gangster <span class=\"bookAuthor\">by Clive Sussler and Justin Scott</span></h3> <p class=\"quote\">Clive Cussler and Justin Scott's mystery novel, \"The Gangster,\" is a novel about murders and a criminal group known as the \"Mano Nera,\" or \"The Black Hand.\" I liked the book, as it provided a lot of information about life in the early 20th century, as well as a thrilling murder story that made the book impossible to put down. The antagonist is hidden throughout the book, and the detective Isaac Bell, journeys through a series of attacks, murder, money and blunder. If only I could read it again!</p> <p class=\"quoteAuthor\">Terrence Kamimura<br>Handsworth Student, Grade 8</p> </div> <div class=\"newBook moreB book11\"> <img src=\"/b7d943b502522a58dc1fdf2d76baa9ef.jpg\" alt=\"Twilight\"> <h3>Twilight <span class=\"bookAuthor\">by Stephenie Meyer</span></h3> <p class=\"quote\">I recently finished reading the Twilight series and I really enjoyed the books. I thought that the author transports you into a world with vampires so well that you start to forget reality. I thought the author was a great writer that makes you want to read more after you finish every book. I highly recommend this series.</p> <p class=\"quoteAuthor\">Natalia Gehry<br>Handsworth Student, Grade 8</p> </div> </div> </div>  <div class=\"larry columns\"> <div class=\"bookLists content\"> <h2>Reading lists</h2> <ul> <a class=\"pdf ext\" href=\"/7bdc56d016faa16d80f0e4606dacf937.html\">First Nations Literature</a><br> <a class=\"pdf ext\" href=\"/3831ad6b569053e9a96d7d40255df957.html\">French Fiction</a><br> <a class=\"pdf ext\" href=\"/df04145717b4846f27d606552fa84e38.html\">LGBTQ Literature</a><br> <a class=\"pdf ext\" href=\"/c027d6e1e349306a7747a134d9ccfeb5.html\">Sports Fiction Books</a><br> <a class=\"pdf ext\" href=\"/424c157e071cbcd46bc04b6afacbfe75.html\">Travel Books</a><br> <a class=\"pdf ext\" href=\"/b221a10741eac74a8ffd72bf7df883fc.html\">Junior Teen Fiction</a><br> <a class=\"pdf ext\" href=\"/193c30893a9720a58086b03879b98a2c.html\">Senior Teen Fiction</a><br> <a class=\"pdf ext\" href=\"/8d0263774c3b62d3772dc6b971461999.html\">Top 100 Teen Books</a> </ul> </div> <div class=\"memes content\"> <img class=\"booksPhoto\" src=\"/840737aba405dd8a26ea43a6ac223ca6.jpg\" alt=\"Books Meme\"> <p class=\"bookCredits\"><em>Book lists curated by Handsworth students Max Park and Arshie Daeizadeh</em></p> </div> </div> <div class=\"rarry columns\"> <div class=\"bookSuggestions content\"> <h2>Reading websites</h2> <ul> <li><a class=\"ext\" href=\"https://www.cmreviews.ca/\">Canadian Review of Materials</a></li> <li><a class=\"ext\" href=\"http://www.jae5tfp.wix.com/hbookblog\">K.
